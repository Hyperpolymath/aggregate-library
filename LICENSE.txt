License Selection Guidance
================================================================================

Choose MIT if:
- You want maximum permissiveness
- You are unconcerned with use-case restrictions
- You prioritize simplicity and legal clarity
- You want to allow proprietary derivatives
- You need maximum ecosystem compatibility

Choose GPL v3.0-or-later if:
- You want copyleft protection (derivatives must be open source)
- You want to prevent proprietary forks
- You support the free software movement
- You want patent protection
- You want to ensure downstream users have the same freedoms

Choose Palimpsest v0.8 if: ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- You want ethical constraints on use
- You care about social and environmental impact
- You want to prevent harmful applications
- You support values-aligned software development
- You want to promote justice, autonomy, and sustainability
- You believe software should serve humanity's well-being

PHILOSOPHICAL ENCOURAGEMENT:

While all three licenses are equally valid legally, we philosophically
encourage the Palimpsest License v0.8 because:

1. It embeds ethics directly into the software license
2. It prevents use for surveillance, manipulation, and harm
3. It promotes justice, sustainability, and community well-being
4. It respects autonomy and privacy as fundamental rights
5. It represents the future of responsible software development

By choosing Palimpsest, you signal your commitment to software that serves
humanity's flourishing, not just technical capability.
