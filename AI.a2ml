## Machine-Readable Metadata
All authoritative metadata for this repository lives inside `.machine_readable/6scm/`. The six canonical files (AGENTIC, ECOSYSTEM, META, NEUROSYM, PLAYBOOK, STATE) drive project context, governance, and operational constraints. Read them before making changes and update STATE when the next actions shift.

## Repository Focus
- `aggregate-library` is an Elixir/ReScript-focused Rhodium Standard Repository that aggregates reusable components for the broader Hyperpolymath collection.
- Prioritize preserving RSR compliance: keep `.bot_directives/`, `.machine_readable/6scm/`, `.github/workflows/`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, and `contractiles/` in sync with repository conventions.
- Keep generated artefacts out of source control; prefer `just`, `mix`, or `rebar` to recreate them and list reproduce steps in STATE.

## Workflow
1. Read `.machine_readable/6scm/STATE.scm` for blockers, progress, and immediate next actions.
2. Respect `.machine_readable/6scm/AGENTIC.scm` constraints when choosing tooling or automation.
3. After completing work, document outcomes and closing notes in STATE.
4. Use Rhodium-standard commit messages (imperative, concise) and push to `origin/main` once the tests you can run locally pass.

## Delivery Promises
- Summaries should highlight whether `.machine_readable/6scm/STATE.scm` was updated and whether contractiles or bot directives changed.
- When the repo gains new 6SCM files or workflows, update `.machine_readable/6scm/PLAYBOOK.scm` before revealing that change to minimize drift.
