A *methods* repository: demonstrating how to specify, test, and stress-test a tiny “overlap” library across wildly different systems — without implying that any one ecosystem should replace its standard library.

toc::[]

== Status
Experimental / research / demonstration.

== What this repo is
This repository is a *stress-test and methods lab* for aLib.

It exists to demonstrate:

* How to identify a minimal overlap (“common”) between systems with very different constraints.
* How to express that overlap as:
  ** a stable spec surface,
  ** semantics notes,
  ** and a conformance test suite.
* How “reversibility” and “safe iteration” can be enforced through disciplined boundaries and test vectors.

This repo is intentionally allowed to be “weird” and “extreme” because its job is to break ideas early.

== What this repo is NOT
To avoid confusion:

* Not a replacement for any ecosystem’s standard library.
* Not a proposal that “all languages should share one stdlib.”
* Not a claim that the overlap shown here is the “correct” overlap for all projects.
* Not a dependency that downstream implementations must import.

This repo demonstrates a method. Implementations may borrow the method, not the code.

== Two meanings of “Common”
In the aLib universe there are two different “common” ideas:

.Overlap Common (this repo)
A demonstration overlap chosen to be stress-tested against extreme diversity.

.Ecosystem Common (implementation repos)
A practical shared layer for a specific ecosystem (example: ReScript + Melange + optional runtime validation).

This repo covers only the first meaning.

== Relationship to implementation repos
Practical implementations live elsewhere, and may legitimately be larger, more ergonomic, and ecosystem-specific.

Examples:

* `alib-for-rescript` (ReScript/Melange-oriented proving ground; optional runtime validation via Proven) — *implementation repo*
* language-specific adapters, codemods, or conformance runners — *implementation support repos*

This repo is the “a priori” proof-of-concept: it exists to make sure the method survives stress.

== Design principles
* Minimal surfaces, explicit semantics.
* Conformance tests as the safety net.
* Reversibility: changes must be easy to evaluate and to undo.
* Ecosystem neutrality: no “blessed” implementation.

== Contents
(Describe your real layout here; placeholder example.)

* `SPEC/` — specifications (surface + semantics)
* `tests/` — conformance vectors and runners
* `notes/` — design rationale, reversibility, tradeoffs
* `examples/` — stress-test cases and demonstrations

== How to use this repo
* Read the spec and the design notes.
* Use the conformance vectors to validate an implementation in your ecosystem.
* Borrow the method for building your own “proving ground” library.

== Contributing
Contributions should optimize for:

* clarity of the overlap definition,
* stronger tests,
* stronger reversibility discipline,
* and reduced ambiguity.

If you are proposing new surface area, you must also propose:
* semantics notes, and
* tests that make regressions obvious.
