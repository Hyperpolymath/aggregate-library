= Changelog

All notable changes to the aggregate-library (aLib) project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

== [Unreleased]

=== Planned
- Grammar mappings for all seven target languages
- Automated compliance testing framework
- Implementation examples in Rust, Ada, TypeScript, Elixir, Haskell, and others
- Cross-language interoperability specifications
- Extended test suites with property-based tests

== [0.1.0] - 2025-11-22

=== Added

==== Specifications
- **Arithmetic Operations** (5): add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo
- **Comparison Operations** (6): less_than, greater_than, equal, not_equal, less_equal, greater_equal
- **Logical Operations** (3): and, or, not
- **String Operations** (3): concat, length, substring
- **Collection Operations** (4): map, filter, fold (reduce), contains
- **Conditional Operations** (1): if_then_else

Total: 20 core operations across 6 categories

==== Documentation
- README.md with project overview, philosophy, and usage guide
- SPEC_FORMAT.md defining minimal specification format (interface signatures + behavioral semantics + executable tests)
- CLAUDE.md with AI assistant guidelines for working with codebase
- LICENSE.txt with dual MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 licensing
- SECURITY.md with comprehensive security policies
- CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines and TPCF Perimeter 3 designation
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md emphasizing emotional safety and community well-being
- MAINTAINERS.md with governance structure
- CHANGELOG.md (this file)

==== Infrastructure
- `.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116 compliant)
- `.well-known/ai.txt` with AI training policies
- `.well-known/humans.txt` with contributor attribution
- `justfile` with validation and documentation recipes
- RSR_COMPLIANCE.md documenting Rhodium Standard Repository compliance

=== Design Decisions

- **Minimal Scope**: Common Library contains only operations that exist across ALL seven target languages (WokeLang, Duet/Ensemble, Eclexia, Oblíbený, RT-Lang, Phronesis, Julia the Viper)
- **Specification-Only**: This repository contains specifications, not implementations
- **Language-Agnostic**: All specifications avoid language-specific assumptions
- **Testable**: Every operation includes concrete, executable test cases in YAML format
- **Offline-First**: All operations are air-gap compatible, no network operations
- **Type-Minimal**: Uses only basic type categories (Number, String, Boolean, Collection, Function)

=== Philosophy

This release establishes the foundation for cross-paradigm, cross-language software development by:
- Reducing programming language territoriality
- Providing a shared vocabulary across radically different paradigms
- Enabling polyglot development with consistent primitives
- Preserving language-specific features in Standard Libraries

== Version History

=== Version Numbering

We follow Semantic Versioning (semver):
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to specifications
- **Minor** (0.x.0): New operations or significant additions
- **Patch** (0.0.x): Clarifications, fixes, documentation improvements

=== Breaking Changes Policy

Breaking changes will be:
- Clearly marked in CHANGELOG
- Announced with sufficient notice (minimum 6 months for 1.0+)
- Discussed with community before implementation
- Minimized wherever possible

=== Deprecation Process

When operations or specifications need to be deprecated:
1. **Announcement**: Marked as deprecated in documentation
2. **Grace Period**: Minimum 2 releases or 12 months (whichever is longer)
3. **Migration Guide**: Provide clear migration path
4. **Removal**: Remove in major version update only

== Release Process

=== Release Criteria

Releases happen when:
- Significant new specifications added (minor version)
- Important clarifications or fixes accumulated (patch version)
- Major redesign or breaking changes (major version)
- Time-based: At least every 6 months if changes exist

=== Release Checklist

Before each release:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] README.md updated with version number
- [ ] Git tag created
- [ ] GitHub release created with notes
- [ ] Community announcement posted

== Notable Milestones

=== Future Milestones

- **v0.2.0**: Grammar mappings for all seven languages
- **v0.3.0**: Reference implementations in at least 3 languages
- **v0.5.0**: Automated compliance testing framework
- **v1.0.0**: Stable specification, production-ready

=== v1.0.0 Criteria

To reach 1.0.0, we need:
- Complete specifications for all 20 operations
- At least 3 verified implementations (different languages)
- Community review and feedback incorporated
- Stability period (6+ months with no breaking changes)
- Production usage in real projects
- Comprehensive test suite validated across implementations
